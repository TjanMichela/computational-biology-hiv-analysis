# Comparative Genomic Analysis of HIV-1, HIV-2, and Control Samples

This project focuses on analyzing and comparing gene sequences of different HIV types (HIV-1 and HIV-2) against control samples (from individuals without HIV). The goal is to uncover genetic differences that may explain variations in viral behavior, pathogenicity, and potential interactions with host genomes.  

## Features  
- Differences in gene sequences between HIV-1, HIV-2, and control samples.  
- Mutation patterns and genetic variations within and between HIV types.  
- Structural and functional implications of these differences.  


## File Structure  
- `data/`: Input genomic sequence data.  
- `scripts/`: Analysis and preprocessing scripts.  
- `results/`: Output files, including visualizations and reports.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
