# Analyzing Breast Cancer Treatments: Gene Expression Differences  

This project investigates the effects of various breast cancer treatments by analyzing genomic sequences. It focuses on comparing gene expression profiles between treated and untreated samples, as well as across different treatment groups, to identify treatment-specific impacts on gene activity.  

## Features  
- **Gene Expression Analysis:** Compare expression levels across treatment and control groups.  
- **Treatment-Specific Insights:** Identify unique gene activity patterns influenced by each treatment.  

## File Structure  
- `data/`: Input genomic sequence data.  
- `scripts/`: Analysis and preprocessing scripts.  
- `results/`: Output files, including visualizations and reports.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
